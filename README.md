# HospitaHealthMonitoringSystemApplication
Central monitoring application which provides observing health parameters for each patient and remote setting ventilator parameters.

The project will require administrator rights (just in case so your firewall doesn't block the server instances) so a visual studio restart will be required.

Run the default project (HospitalHealthMonitoringSystemClient).

Project will start and automatically load the servers as well as the safe values and beds (the .json files can be found inside the /Hospital health monitoring system/ folder).

Values will be retrived randomly from the servers.

Use the Set parameters button to manually set the values of specific parameters.


Enjoy! :)
